X 1. Create a new class PokeType that is initialized with a name, and has a class method .all that returns an array of all the PokeTypes
2. Before we scrape, we'll create 5 made-up PokeTypes
3. When we scrape the Pokemon, we'll associate it with a random PokeType
4. We'll write an instance method in PokeTypes #pokemon that returns all the Pokemon associated with this PokeType.
